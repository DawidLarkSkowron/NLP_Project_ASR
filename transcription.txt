 Walking's my favorite exercise. Here's a nice quiet place to rest. Our janitor sweeps the floors every night. It would be much easier if everyone would help. Good morning. Open your window before you go to bed. Do you think that she should stay out so late? How do you feel about changing the time when we begin work? Here we go. Move out of the way.
